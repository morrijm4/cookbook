- 6 g (1.5 tsp) instant yeast
- 5 g (1 tsp) honey, sugar, or agave 
- 10 g (2 tsp) fine sea salt

- Flaky sea salt to finish 
- Toppings of choice: rosemary, garlic, butter, peppers, cheese, onions, etc.

For garlic butter, cheese, and rosemary topping: 
- 2 tbsp salted butter
- 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil 
- 10 cloves garlic minced
- Fresh rosemary
- Italian cheese blend, mozarella, and/or parmesan

## Instructions

1. Whisk together warm water, olive oil, honey and yeast
2. Stir in bread flour and salt 
3. Cover bowl with kitchen cloth and rest at room temperature for 15 minutes
4. Stretch and fold the dough about 8 times around the bowl, cover and rest at room temperature for 15 minutes
5. Repeat the stretch and fold once more, flip the dough over into a ball, cover and proof at room temperature for 1-1.5 hrs
6. Line 9x13 metal baking tray (if using glass, decrease oven temperature by 25 degrees and cook for a little bit longer) with nonstick parchemnt paper (can use larger tray for thinner/crispier bread)
7. Coat the bottom of the tray with EVOO and then the parchment paper with EVOO generously 
8. Transfer the dough to the tray and fold it into thirds, turn it, and flip it over length wise, cover and proof at room temperature for 1-1.5 hours
9. Preheat oven to 430F, place the oven rack in the lowest position
10. If making the garlic butter: heat butter and olive oil in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, add garlic and let simmer on low for about 1-2 minutes so it doesn't burn
11. Spread dough to edges, scatter over rosemary, 2/3 of the garlic butter, 1/2 the cheese, and flaky sea salt, drizzle with olive oil and dimple 
12. Bake for 18-24 minutes on the lowest rack to help the bottom of the bread crisp up, pulling the bread out about halfway through the cooking to add the remaining 1/2 cheese
13. Brush with the remaining 1/3 of the garlic butter and let it cool for about 15 minutes before cutting into it and serving
